## Quick Start (Workshop Setup)

**Get your own copy in 5 steps - no coding required.**

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

Go to [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup) and create a free account.

### Step 2: Fork This Repository

1. Click the **"Fork"** button (top right of this page)
2. On the next screen, click **"Create fork"**
3. Done! You now have your own copy at `github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/business-x-ray`

> **What's a fork?** It creates your own copy of this project on GitHub. Your diagrams save here, and you can get my updates anytime.

### Step 3: Open in Codespaces

1. Go to YOUR fork (should be on your screen after Step 2)
2. Click the green **"Code"** button
3. Select **"Codespaces"** tab → **"Create codespace on master"**
4. Wait ~1 minute for it to load

### Step 4: Install Claude Code

1. In Codespaces, click the **Extensions** icon (left sidebar, looks like 4 squares)
2. Search for **"Claude Code"**
3. Click **Install**
4. Click **"Sign in"** when prompted and connect your Claude account

### Step 5: Run the Skill

In the Claude Code chat, type:

```
Let's do a business x-ray
```

That's it! Claude will guide you through mapping your business.

## Getting Updates

When I release improvements, here's how to get them:

1. Go to your fork on GitHub (`github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/business-x-ray`)
2. You'll see a banner: **"This branch is X commits behind the2hourclo:master"**
3. Click **"Sync fork"** → **"Update branch"**
4. Next time you open Codespaces, you'll have the latest version

> **Will this overwrite my diagrams?** No! Sync Fork only updates the skill files I changed. Your diagrams in the `diagrams/` folder are yours and won't be touched.

---

## Alternative: Plugin Install (For Existing Claude Code Users)

If you already have Claude Code installed locally:

```bash
claude plugins install https://github.com/the2hourclo/business-x-ray
```

Then just say: **"Let's do a business x-ray"**

Plugin auto-updates when I push changes.

## Connect Draw.io to GitHub

Your diagrams save to the `diagrams/` folder. Sync them with Draw.io:

1. Go to [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net)
2. Click **File → Open from → GitHub**
3. Authorize with your GitHub account
4. Select this repository
5. Your diagrams will sync automatically!

## How It Works

### The Interview Process

Claude acts as a business consultant, asking one question at a time:

1. **Business Map** - Extracts your traffic sources, products, funnels, team, and goals
2. **Bow-Tie Funnel** - Maps your customer journey from discovery to results
3. **Lead Gen Process** - Drills into how you generate and qualify leads
4. **Sales Process** - Maps discovery → presentation → proposal → close
5. **Fulfillment** - Maps onboarding → delivery → support → results

### 3-Level Drill-Down

| Level | Shows | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Level 1** | WHO does the work | Owner creates content, AI distributes, Team handles support |
| **Level 2** | WHICH systems handle it | ConvertKit for email, Calendly for booking, Notion for CRM |
| **Level 3** | HOW each system works | Step-by-step execution with tool names |

### Opportunity Discovery

As you map your business, Claude identifies:

- **Bottlenecks** (Red) - Steps slowing everything down
- **Automate** (Orange) - AI/tools could handle this
- **High Value** (Green) - Keep doing this yourself
- **Digital Assets** (Purple) - Templates/SOPs needed
