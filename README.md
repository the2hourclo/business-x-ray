## How It Works

### The Interview Process

Claude acts as a business consultant, asking one question at a time:

1. **Business Map** - Extracts your traffic sources, products, funnels, team, and goals
2. **Bow-Tie Funnel** - Maps your customer journey from discovery to results
3. **Lead Gen Process** - Drills into how you generate and qualify leads
4. **Sales Process** - Maps discovery → presentation → proposal → close
5. **Fulfillment** - Maps onboarding → delivery → support → results

### 3-Level Drill-Down

| Level | Shows | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Level 1** | WHO does the work | Owner creates content, AI distributes, Team handles support |
| **Level 2** | WHICH systems handle it | ConvertKit for email, Calendly for booking, Notion for CRM |
| **Level 3** | HOW each system works | Step-by-step execution with tool names |

### Opportunity Discovery

As you map your business, Claude identifies:

- **Bottlenecks** (Red) - Steps slowing everything down
- **Automate** (Orange) - AI/tools could handle this
- **High Value** (Green) - Keep doing this yourself
- **Digital Assets** (Purple) - Templates/SOPs needed
